<p>1) Question: What is a web server? Why would you need one?</p>



<p>Answer: A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients. Dedicated computers and appliances may be referred to as Web servers as well.


The process is an example of the client/server model. All computers that host Web sites must have Web server programs. Leading Web servers include Apache (the most widely-installed Web server), Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) and nginx (pronounced engine X) from NGNIX. Other Web servers include Novell's NetWare server, Google Web Server (GWS) and IBM's family of Domino servers.

Web servers often come as part of a larger package of Internet- and intranet-related programs for serving email, downloading requests for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) files, and building and publishing Web pages. Considerations in choosing a Web server include how well it works with the operating system and other servers, its ability to handle server-side programming, security characteristics, and  the particular publishing, search engine and site building tools that come with it.</p>



<p>2) Question: Explain why getting a domain name is not enough to put your site up on the web.</p>


<p>Answer: Once your website is created, you will need to store all of its files somewhere. This is where a web host comes in. A web host will, as its name suggests, host all of your website’s content for people to access over the Internet. Your website may be digital, but its files still need to be stored on a physical hard drive and accessible on the Internet using a server.


Though one leads to the other, buying a domain name doesn’t mean you have a website. A domain is the name of a website, a URL is how to find a website, and a website is what people see and interact with when they get there. In other words, when you buy a domain, you have purchased the name for your site, but you still need to build the site.

In digital terms, a website is a collection of content, often on multiple pages, that is grouped together under the same domain. You can think of it like a store, where the domain is the store name, the URL is the store address, and the website is the actual store, with shelves full of products and a cash register.

Luckily, building a website is much easier, faster, and more economical than building a store or office. Today, there are many great companies who make it possible for anyone to build and customize a beautiful website in just a few hours — and most don’t require any knowledge of HTML or other codes. To learn more about building your site, check out our post on how to make the most of your domain.

In order to create a website, you need a few things:

A domain name (such as yoursite.com)
A domain registrar and host (such as Google Domains)
A do-it-yourself website builder, like SquareSpace or Wix, or a web designer
Digital content — the text, images, videos, and other media that visitors will see when they come to your site.</p>

<p>3) Question: What service does a website hosting company provide?</p>

<p>Answer: Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page onto the Internet. A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed in the Internet. Websites are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers. When Internet users want to view your website, all they need to do is type your website address or domain into their browser. Their computer will then connect to your server and your webpages will be delivered to them through the browser.

Most hosting companies require that you own your domain in order to host with them. If you do not have a domain, the hosting companies will help you purchase one.</p>

<p>1) Here are some features you should be expecting from your hosting provider:
Email Accounts	As mentioned earlier, most hosting providers require users to have their own domain name. With a domain name (e.g. www.yourwebsite.com) and email account features provided by your hosting company, you can create domain email accounts (e.g. yourname@yourwebsite.com).

2) FTP Access	The use of FTP lets you upload files from your local computer to your web server. If you build your website using your own HTML files, you can transfer the files from your computer to the web server through FTP, allowing your website to be accessed through the internet.

3) WordPress Support	WordPress is an online website creation tool. It is a powerful blogging and website content management system, which is a convenient way to create and manage website. WordPress powers over 25% of websites on the internet. Most hosting providers will tell you right away if their plans are WordPress-compatible or not. The simple requirements for hosting your WordPress websites include: PHP version 7 or greater; MySQL version 5.6 or greater.


4) If you decide to create and host your website with Website.com, in addition to access to the drag and drop site builder, you can get a custom domain, email addresses, and web hosting all bundled into one subscription.

In order to publish your website online, your business website requires a web hosting service. However, a web host gives business owners more than just web hosting services! For example, web hosting firms typically employ in-house technicians to make sure their clients' websites are up and running 24/7. Plus, when website owners are in need of help or troubleshooting (e.g. script debutting, email not able to send/receive, domain name renewal, and more), the web host's in-house support are the go-to people. A professional web hosting service ensures a hassle-free experience for business owners, so they can efficiently focus their time and effort on their businesses.</p>

<p> 4)Question: What are the most important characteristics to look for in selecting a good web hosting company?</p>


<p>Answer: we can consider many factors such as,

1) Solid/Reliability

Every time your web site goes down, so does your number of visitors. If you lose visitors, then you lose profit, members, reputation, etc. You cannot afford for your web site to be down—even for a short amount of time! To ensure the web host you’re looking at will be reliable, find out how many customers they have (typically the more the better), see if they have a guaranteed up-time, search for complaints about them on the internet and ask other users using their service about their experience (if you know any).

2) Speed

No one likes to wait in line to get what they want—they want it now or they wanted it yesterday. Starbucks delivers quickly and people know that the Starbucks line (even if long) moves fast. If your web site loads slow because it’s on an overburdened server or on a slow network, your visitors will go somewhere else. Make sure its blazing fast. Test the web hosts site and some of their customer’s sites to see how fast they load.

3) Space

Starbucks usually have indoor and outdoor seating to accommodate the most people. It’s not easy to move a restaurant and it’s not easy to move your web site. Make sure you have more than enough space for what you plan to do with your web site. Web space is cheap, so get a lot of it.

4) Substantial Bandwidth

Imagine if Starbucks was only allowed to have 1,000 customers per day and then they had to close their doors. This is essentially what bandwidth is for web sites. If you have too much traffic and use too much bandwidth, they cut off your web site or charge you more. It protects the web hosting companies from having someone who uses up all of the server resources. Make sure your web host allows you to buy more bandwidth should you someday need it.

5) Support

If you walked into a Starbucks and you couldn’t find an employee to take your order that would be really frustrating. When you have a problem with your web hosting company, you want to be able to reach some one and get a quick response. Find out if they have a published phone number, their hours of support, and how easy it is to reach someone.

6) Superior Features & Technology

When was the last time you heard some one ask for something at Starbucks they couldn’t make? When it comes to your web site, make sure you have all the options you need. Look into their control panel, number of allowed sub-domains, scripting language support, databases, and whether it is hosted on a Windows or Unix platform.

7) Sufficient Email

Find out if there is a limit to the number of email boxes you can have and what other email features they support. Make sure you have full control over them and can manage them yourself.

8) Secure Location

Web hosts that are local will likely be faster, more reliable and easier to contact than those that are not nearby. It’s best to at least have the web server be in the same country as most of your visitors. It doesn’t make sense to use a hosting company in the UK or Europe if you all of your visitors are in the United States. Also, make sure your web site information will be safe and secure on their servers.

9) Standard Pricing/Payment Plans

Finally, the last thing we can learn from Starbucks is that you get what you pay for. Starbucks charges more but you get better, faster service more of the time than you do at other coffee shops. When it comes to your web hosting company, you will usually get what you pay for—there are exceptions to every rule, but in general this is true. Also, beware for hosting companies that lure you with a low price but nickel and dime you for extra features that are standard on most web hosts.

Domain names can be registered with an independent domain registrar, or with a web hosting provider that will host the website attached to the name. They are responsible for checking name availability and maintaining records on registered domains. Domain name registrars must be accredited by Top Level Domain registries, which are in turn accredited by ICANN.</p>

<p>Question: Best Value for price Host</p>
<p>Answer: Bluehost</p>


<p>5)Question: What are the most important features for you when reviewing a hosting plan?</p>



<p>Answer: A typical web hosting service allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. In a nutshell, the host owns a server and leases you some space on it to run your website. There are hundreds of web hosts out there and it can be very confusing to settle for a service provider, especially when you are new to setting up a website.

Here are seven important features to bear in mind before selecting a web hosting service.

1) The Nature of Your Website
Determine the nature of your website. You need to ensure your web host provides you a cluster of services that match your website’s requirement. For instance, if you’re creating a social media website, you would consider factors such as performance, network latency, the ability to carry on background tasks and front end delivery activities.


The requirements change according to the nature of the website. While there can be common requirements, your priorities would shift based on the type of website.

2) The Cost Involved
There are mainly two costs involved in a web hosting service. The first is the cost of setting up or installing a web hosting service. The other cost is the renewal expenses that are incurred at regular intervals to continue the service.

While a few providers charge less at the time of setting up, their renewal costs might be high. Before picking, please check the terms and conditions.

3) Shared V/S Dedicated Web Hosting
Another factor that determines the choice of a web host for your site is whether you are looking for a shared or dedicated web hosting service. While shared web hosting is very cheap and allows many other websites to be on the same server space, you might have to compromise on performance due to heavily loaded servers.

On the other hand, a dedicated hosting service provides you the entire server space, giving you total control. This might be a costly choice. Prioritize well before choosing between the two.

4) Reputation and Reviews of the Host
Before falling for lucrative offers, take some time to study the server’s reputation in the market. Reviews posted by users of hosting services provide great information about their quality standards and trustworthiness.

Always go for a web hosting provider that holds a decent market value over a host that offers huge discounts. It can be worth paying for higher quality to save you headaches down the line.

5) Addon Domain Services
When you grow your business, you want to have addon domains. Having addon domains allows you to create several domain names and websites while sticking to one host. Also, it saves your money as you don’t have to pay multiple hosts. It also enables you to gain SEO benefits.

However, many web hosting providers have a limit to addon domains, ranging from one to 50 domain names. Choose wisely!

6) The Speed of Your Web Host
You definitely want your website to be fast. A slow website that takes forever to load is always a turn-off. The speed of your website depends on the web hosting service. A simple trick to select a web host that delivers excellent speed is to track a few past surveys that are regularly conducted to test the fastest web hosting service. Select a provider which has consistently topped the charts.

7) User-Friendliness
A web host has to provide easy-to-handle services to its clients. Every individual or organization should focus on the user-friendliness of its control panel. In the long run, using a web hosting service that is too complicated to operate will be a pain. It’s better to take a trial session with a few service providers before you finally settle on the right one.

The selection of a good web host is very, very important for your website. Further performance of your website will largely depend on this. You definitely do not want to regret your choice. Watch out and settle only for what’s appropriate.</p>
