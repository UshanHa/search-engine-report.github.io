<p>Question: What is an internet domain name?</p>


<p>Answer: A domain name in its simplest form is just an Internet Website address.

Just as your house or apartment has its own unique identifying address for the post office, so does each and every Website in existence.

The domain name system was originally created for the benefit of humans.

The actual address used by computers is numerical in format and is referred to as an IP, or Internet Protocol, address.

An IP address takes the form of four series of numbers separated by periods.

The domain "Name" system was created.

These are not really domain names in full, but rather they are subsections of a domain name.

Sasezpublications.com and the rest of the address denotes where on that domain you would like to view pages.

So if you were to have your website at the location above, you would not have your own domain.

Instead you would have web pages hosted in a directory on someone else's domain.
An Internet domain name is a unique name of an organization or person on the Internet. The name is combined with a generic top-level domain (gTLD), such as .com or .org. For example, computerlanguage.com is the domain name for the publisher of this encyclopedia. By 2019, there were more than 300 million registered domain names.</p>





2) 



<p>Question: Why are domain names so important on the web?</p>


<p>On a basic level, domain names are important because the Internet's addressing scheme is not very effective without them.

Since remembering the IP addresses of all of your favorite Web sites would be nearly impossible, a group of computer scientists created the domain name system to assign a unique name to each numeric IP address.

Domain names are much more than just a technical shortcut.

A short, memorable domain name can make the difference between creating a successful Web presence and getting lost in cyberspace.

A domain name adds credibility to your small business.

Having your own domain name makes your company look professional.

If you're not willing to pay the money to register an appropriate domain name, why would consumers think you'd put any effort into creating valuable products or services? A domain name says you're forward-thinking.

Having your own domain name indicates you're part of the Digital Revolution, and it implies that you're up-to-date on emerging technologies.

A domain name adds mobility to your Internet presence.

Owning your own domain name lets you take that name with you if you transfer Web hosts or switch to your own in-house server.

If you don't own your domain name, you'll have to take a new URL, which will destroy the branding that you built up with your first address.

If you decide to register a domain name that matches the concept of your business, you might draw Web surfers in search of that topic.

More than anything else, a domain name can increase awareness of your brand.

If your domain name matches your company name, it reinforces your brand, making it easier for customers to remember and return.

<p>Question: Why do domain names have to be unique?</p>

<p>Individuals sometimes like to have their own domain for vanity or notoriety reasons. Other times they have a family or genealogy Website and having a domain name for that site helps it to be found and remembered easier. For instance if your name is Sheila Brooks, you could try to get the domain name of "sheilabrooks.com" so that anyone looking for you online would easily find you. If you have a family Website then a domain name such as "brooksfamily.com" would give it a nice touch. If you are an up and coming author, artist, activist, volunteer or otherwise it would also give you a unique and memorable address with which to promote your causes.

In the business world, domain names are becoming as common as telephone and fax numbers. If your advertisements and business cards don't display a domain name, you run the risk of being completely passed over by customers that prefer to browse merchandise and services online.

A good domain name is vital for a business. If the name does not match your business name or slogan then it must be closely related to one or both. Your domain name must also be easy to remember so that customers do not have to work hard to find your site online. Having a registered domain name with a live Website is sometimes the first priority for a business today, because it is a very inexpensive way to get your business name and information in front of the public.

Other primary reasons for a business to register one or more domain names is to protect copyrights and trademarks, secure unique product names and increase their brand awareness with the public.</p>

<p>What does it mean to "register" a domain name?</p>


<p>The only way to register and start using a domain name is to use the services of a domain name registrar.

The domain name industry is regulated and overseen by ICANN, the organization that is responsible for certifying companies as domain name registrars.

Only a domain name registrar is permitted to access and modify the master database of domain names maintained by InterNIC. The master database contains the documentation on all of the domain names registered to date.</p>


5)
<p>If you wanted a domain name that is already taken, how could you get it?</p>

<p>If you come across a registrar that is not on the list it is most likely that the organization is acting as a reseller for one of the accredited registrars as only an accredited registrar has the ability to modify the database of domain names.

There are many laws that regulate the registration of domain names, such as registering a copyrighted name or registering a domain name for the sole purpose of blocking someone else from using it.

Check with your domain name registrar for the laws that affect how you register your domain name.

If you want to create a domain name and are not sure if it has already been taken, you can check a whois server that keeps track of all the registered domain names.</p>

<p>Information about getting your own domain name:</p>

<p>Domain names can be registered with an independent domain registrar, or with a web hosting provider that will host the website attached to the name. They are responsible for checking name availability and maintaining records on registered domains. Domain name registrars must be accredited by Top Level Domain registries, which are in turn accredited by ICANN. 

Registrars do not provide web hosting, they simply manage the databases of domain names in use. If you do not currently have web hosting, or you are simply reserving your ideal domain name or names for later use, registrars can “park” your domain name temporarily until you’re ready to launch your site. If you’ve already set up an account with a hosting provider, you can complete the entire name search and registration process on the providers site.

To register a domain, you will simply need to provide your chosen name and some information about yourself as the registrant who will be responsible for the domain. Registrars typically request standard contact information such as a physical address, phone number, and email address. This information goes into a Whois database, which stores contact information about domain registrants and makes it available to the public, so that anyone can look up the owner of a domain.

To complete the registration process, you will be asked to sign a contract. It is important to review the registrar contract carefully since it generally contains provisions about things like transferring your domain from one registrar to another, or limits on the length of time a domain can remain parked without being deleted.

You will also need to select a term when it comes time to renew your domain name, typically one, three, or five years, and then pay the required fees for your chosen term. Although people speak about “buying” a domain name, in reality, users are simply paying for its use for a particular period of time. If a domain name isn’t renewed at the appropriate time, it could lapse and become available again. Unused and lapsed domains are often bought and sold at online auctions and domain marketplaces.


Once you have registered your new domain, you can begin planning to set up your site. If you have not already arranged for hosting, it might be time to shop for a host that offers the features and pricing you want. And if you aren’t ready to do that yet, your domain can remain parked as long as you keep up the registration. Domains that are registered through a web host are typically ready to set up using the tools provided by the host. If your domain is parked at a registrar site, you may need to take some additional steps to make sure that your domain name points to your website.

Registering your domain name is the first step in the process of launching your website. With relatively low costs for registration and renewals, your domain name is the unique “address” that connects your brand with the world.</p>
