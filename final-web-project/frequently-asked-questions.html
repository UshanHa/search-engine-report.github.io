<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h1> I do not have any watches. What should I purchase first?</h1>

<p>Best Answer: It does not matter if you have any watches when you set out to begin watch collecting. This hobby doesn’t require the person to have any real working knowledge or equipment to start. The best thing that you can do when you’re ready to begin watch collecting as a hobby is to read and learn about watches, from the early days to modern digital watches that are designed for space travel.

As far as what you should purchase first, that is entirely up to you. Travel around town on the weekends and visit garage sale and tag sales, as well as flea markets, and look for inexpensive watches. With enough attention, one can find some great classic watches. Just be certain that you don’t purchase an imitation watch while thinking that it is actually an original antique.</p>

<h1>.I do not have a lot of money to spare, can I still start watch collecting?</h1>

<p>Best Answer: Absolutely. Many people begin their watch collecting hobby by bartering and exchanging items they are willing to part with, and that those with the watches would like themselves. Money isn’t the only method of payment and there are services that can be offered in exchange for a particular watch.

Even if there is a price tag on the watch you want, it does not hurt to ask the owner to find out if they are willing to work out a different arrangement.</p>

<h1>What are the main parts of a watch?</h1>

<p>Best Answer: A watch is made up of:

<ul>

<li>A calibre/movement (can be in-house, factory made or ebauched)</li>

<li>A case to hold the movement (can be made of steel, gold, platinum, titanium, bronze, wood etc)</li>

<li>A case front (can be sapphire crystal or acrylic or mineral glass) and a case back (can also be any of the afore-mentioned or solid metal so it isn’t see through)</li>

<li>A dial or face to display the time (and other complications)</li>

<li>A band (NB the bits that stick out of a case to secure a band are called ‘lugs’. </li></ul></p>

<h1>What are the different types of movements?</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>1)Best Answer: Quartz or Electronic movements (or modules as they are known) have few or no moving parts, as they use the piezoelectric effect in a tiny quartz crystal to provide a stable time base for a mostly electronic movement. The crystal forms a quartz oscillator which resonates at a specific and highly stable frequency, and which can be used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism. For this reason, electronic watches are often called quartz watches.</p><li>

2)Mechanical movements, as the name suggests use various mechanical parts in an escapement mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring. Mechanical movements also use a balance wheel together with the balance spring (also known as a hairspring) to control motion of the gear system of the watch. similar in function to the pendulum of a pendulum clock. There are basically 2 main types of mechanical movements:</p></li></ul>
